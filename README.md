# Roots Bluestacks instantly with cmd script


## How to Use

1. Download `blueStackRoot.cmd` in [releases](https://github.com/Jordan231111/BluestacksRoot/releases) or download/clone the entire repo.

2. Launch the BlueStacks instance that you want to root once beforehand.

3. Exit all BlueStacks instances or Multi-Instance Manager.

4. Run the `blueStackRoot.cmd` file (grant admin permissions when prompted).

5. If the following popup appears, click "More info" and then "Run anyway" (Windows blocks ALL .cmd files by default):
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting

6. Wait for the rooting process to complete in the command prompt window. Then install magisk delta to system partition
**Important:** DO NOT unroot until Magisk says it's installed and you get the SU conflict message in the Magisk app.
You must turn off and on the emulator after script has complete at least confirm you got the SU conflict message

7. Go back to script and undo the root for that version

8. For convenience, Magisk Kitsune is provided in this repository.

## Other Important Information
- For BlueStacks instances running Android 11, please use my uploaded Magisk or the Magisk version available at: [https://github.com/HuskyDG/magisk-files/releases/tag/1707294287](https://github.com/HuskyDG/magisk-files/releases/tag/1707294287)

- BlueStacks instances running Android 9 are only supported by Magisk version 25.2. Please note that using this outdated version is at your own risk, as it may contain unpatched vulnerabilities or compatibility issues. It is highly recommended to upgrade your BlueStacks instance to a newer version of Android for better stability and security.
